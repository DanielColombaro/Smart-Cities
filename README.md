# The Impact of Short-Term-Rentals on European Cities A Study of Existing Policies and Recommendations for Future Strategies

This repository includes the data and the code used to study the impact of the policies to regulate **short-term-rentals** (STRs). This study examines the impact of short-term rentals (STRs), specifically focusing on Airbnb, on urban housing markets, demographic shifts, and regulatory responses in **Barcelona**. Building on previous studies that have highlighted the correlation between STR growth and housing market inflation, this analysis seeks to quantify the growth of STRs over the past fifteen years and evaluate their effects on property sales, rental prices, and population distribution within the cityâ€™s districts. The findings indicate a significant rise in Airbnb listings, driving inflationary pressures in both the sales and rental markets, particularly before regulatory interventions were introduced. The study underscores the effectiveness of policies like the **Special Tourist Accommodation Plan** (PEUAT), which mitigated the adverse effects of STRs by restricting new tourist licenses and enforcing minimum rental periods. A comparative analysis with **Milan**, where regulations remain lenient, highlights the critical role of robust regulatory frameworks in curbing the negative externalities of the STR market while balancing economic benefits and housing affordability.
